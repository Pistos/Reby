Reby: Ruby-Eggdrop Bridge Yes-this-letter-no-meaning-in-the-acronym
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.5.3

To use Reby with your eggdrop:

1) Move the "reby*" files to some appropriate location such as
/path/to/your/eggdrop/scripts .  At the least, reby.tcl, reby.rb and reby.conf
should be together.

2) Enable the .tcl command in your eggdrop's conf, if it isn't already.
This is usually done by commenting out the following line:
unbind dcc n tcl *dcc:tcl

3) Rehash the eggdrop (with the .rehash party line command) to reload the
changed eggdrop configuration and include the reby.tcl script.

4) Edit the reby.conf file.  It is heavily commented and self-explanatory.

5) Run the reby.rb program.  You can run it in the background, pipe stdout or
stderr wherever you like--whatever you want.  By default, it does not run as
a daemon, and it writes status and error messages to stdout.

It also looks for a configuration file called reby.conf in the same directory.
You can pass the path to a specific configuration file as an argument to
reby.rb.

And that's it!  :)  I hope you enjoy using Reby!
